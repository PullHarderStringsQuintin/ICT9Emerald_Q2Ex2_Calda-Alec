	<h1>THE GREATEST FIGHTERS OF ALL TIME </h1>

	<div id="intro">
		<h2>The mount rushmore of combat</h2>
		<p>MMA is a sport still in it's infant stage. It has only been active for around 30 years, where it has been ostracized and branded as "human cockfighting". However it has now risen as one of, if not the most popular combat sport. It's largest promotion, the UFC or Ultimate Fighter Championship boasts an illustrious history filled with some of the best martial artists ever. Names such as Conor McGregor, Brock Lesnar, Khabib Nurmagomedov and much more adorn the golden belt which signifies the best. However, within all of these golden men, you will find 4 which shine like diamonds.</p>
	</div>

<div id="DJ">
	<h2>Demetrious Johnson</h2>
	<p>The first one is the 5'2, Flyweight GOAT, Demetrious "Mighty Mouse" Johnson. DJ has an astounding 10 title wins in the lightest weight division in MMA. His fighting style employs the use of heavy pressure and fast quick strikes which would lead to his most powerful weapon, his wrestling. His speed and his technique would lead him to defeat and dominate his division so much, that the UFC actually had to trade him in hopes of increasing competition among the flyweights. Today Mighty Mouse is still active and is currently the Flyweight One champion, a testament to his perseverance and ability to adapt.</p>

</div>
<div id="Silva">
	<h2>Anderson Silva</h2>
	<p>The second fighter on mount rushmore is the greatest champion in UFC history. Anderson "The Spider" Silver. Silva boasts one of, if not the most technically profound styles in all of Mixed Martial Arts. He is an absolute purist, a master in Muay Thai, Capoeira, Wrestling, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and so many more. This avatar-like mastery would lead him to have the greatest championship reign in the sport. He would have the longest winning streak in the history of the UFC with 16 wins. His title reign lasted 7 years from 2006-2013, which included 10 title defenses in complete dominant fashion. Even after old age, he would go down in history as the man adorned in gold, and gold, and gold. If you were around during his time, you wouldnt check who the middleweight champion was, because his name was ALWAYS Anderson Silva.</p>

</div>
<div id="GSP">
	<h2>George St. Pierre</h2>
	<p>The third fighter is a man whos career seems like a fairy tail, George "Rush" St.Pierre, better known by his initials "GSP". He is the greatest wrestler that the sport would ever be blessed with, with the most takedowns, and the highest takedown defense of all time. His profound skill would land himself champion of the Welterweight division. However he would actually lose to Matt Sierra and Matt Hughes. But this is the best part of his career, he would reclaim his belt in brutal and dominant fashion, proving himself the best of his era. He retired, but he came back to put a cherry on top. As if his career wasnt beautiful enough, he captured yet another belt in another weight class, adding more gold to his waist. he would be one of the only people ever to hold 2 championships belt AT THE SAME TIME. He retired with 9 title defenses and the consensus greatest of all time. </p>

<div id="bones">
	<h2>Jon Jones</h2>
	<p> But the last, and CERTAINLY not least, we have the most enigmatic figure, a boogeyman who mesmerized and hypnotized fans and opponents alike. The greatest Lightheavy weight. Jon "Bones" Jones. This man is the only person on this list who has never lost. Boasting a perfect 29-1 record, with his only defeat coming from disqualification because he was hitting too hard. A man who came onto the sport, became the youngest champion ever, and would strangle hold the title. Fighters came, and fighters fell. He holds an impressive 15 title wins in his career, the most in UFC history. With most of his fights being utter dominant slaughterfests. However, his career would be utterderailed when he fought his greatest rival, Daniel "DC" Cormier. This isnt because he got destroyed in the fight, but because he won so easily, which brew the USADA controversy and exposed his use of Performance Enhancing Drugs. He also has a reputation for beating his wife, a known excessive partier, and was involved in a hit and run incident involving a pregnant woman. Yet despite these things, he would still rise as one of, if not the greatest fighter of all time.</p>
